added datasets from: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8389581/#_ad93_
four distinct sheets, will need to combine or pick one set

not sure what to do when it comes to "reproducable script", maybe this refers to R?

#2/20/25
- removed old data set, new data comes from ncbi. see the fna file for more info
- Used MUSCLE on new data: pseudomonas.fna
- should be aligned?

#3/4/25
- updated fasta alignments
- wrote r script using ape and pranghorn
	- follows the same process as class, except uses njs() due to an error
